# Analysis-of-Work-Hours-and-Income-Data

This project explores the relationship between work hours and income using the "adult.csv" dataset. It employs Python and data visualization libraries to uncover patterns and correlations, shedding light on how work-life balance and income intertwine.

Objectives:
- Analyze the distribution of income among individuals
- Explore the distribution of hours worked per week
- Uncover the relationship between hours worked and income
- Identify income differences based on work hours

Methodology:
1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
   - Import necessary libraries
   - Load the "adult.csv" dataset
   - Check for missing values and handle accordingly
   - Convert categorical variables to numerical representations

2. Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Visualize the distribution of income using histograms
   - Analyze the distribution of hours worked per week using histograms
  
3. Bivariate Analysis
   - Create boxplots to visualize the relationship between hours worked and income
   - Calculate correlation coefficient to quantify the relationship
  
4. Hypothesis Testing
   - Perform t-tests to determine if there's a significant difference in average work hours between income groups
  
Results:
- 75.15% of individuals have an income below $50,000 per year
- Most individuals work around 40 hours per week
- A positive correlation exists between hours worked and income
- Individuals earning over $50,000 per year work an average of 45.35 hours per week, while those earning less work an average of 38.94 hours

Conclusion:
The project reveals a significant connection between work hours and income, suggesting that individuals working longer hours tend to earn more. It highlights the importance of work-life balance and its implications on economic outcomes.
